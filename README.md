#To Do
[ ] adjust index layout
[ ] develop appropriate query for index
[ ] resolve indeterminate player issue on `views/play.jade`
[ ] add jquery to `package.json` for offline development
[ ] render game in `views/play.jade`

#Notes
I really wish we could move sockets/routes into their own files from `app.js`
