#To Do
- [x] adjust index layout
- [ ] develop appropriate query for index
- [ ] resolve indeterminate player issue on `views/play.jade`
- [x] add jquery to `package.json` for offline development - [patch!][1]
- [ ] render game in `views/play.jade`

#Notes
I really wish we could move sockets/routes into their own files from `app.js`
